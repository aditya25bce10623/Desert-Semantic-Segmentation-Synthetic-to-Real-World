# Desert-Semantic-Segmentation-Synthetic-to-Real-World
Duality AI Offroad Semantic Segmentation Submission README

Project Overview

This project implements a semantic segmentation model trained on synthetic desert data provided by Duality AI. The objective is to segment terrain classes at the pixel level and evaluate generalization performance on unseen desert environments. Primary evaluation metric: Mean Intersection over Union (IoU).
